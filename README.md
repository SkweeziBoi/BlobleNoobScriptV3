Over the past few weeks, I have been learning how to write scripts for games. Anyway, I came across this game called [bloble.io](http://bloble.io) (which, like other io games is dying). I thought it would be cool to mod it. It started as something small, but now it has grown to introduce dozens of mods to the game. This repository contains: 1. The script itself, 2. The backend for the script, 3. A detailed and educational guide of the features, and how to fix it (if you are a game developer)
